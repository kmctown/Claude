# Specialized AI Agents

This directory contains specialized AI agent definitions used by Claude Code to handle complex, domain-specific tasks. Each agent is an expert in their field and can work autonomously to deliver comprehensive solutions.

## How Agents Work

Agents are intelligent, autonomous specialists that:
- Analyze requirements and create execution plans
- Perform complex multi-step tasks independently
- Utilize all available tools and knowledge
- Coordinate with other agents when needed
- Deliver complete, production-ready solutions


## Installation Guide

To maintain a single source of truth for agent configurations, you can symlink the agents directory in this repository to your `~/.claude/agents` directory:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/this/repository/agents ~/.claude/agents
```

This creates a symbolic link that points to your main agents repository, ensuring all changes are synchronized automatically. Whenever changes are made to the agents in this repository, you can pull the latest changes by running:

```bash
cd /path/to/this/repository
git pull
```

## The Orchestrator's Role

The **Project Orchestrator** serves as the master conductor, analyzing complex requirements and coordinating multiple agents:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Breaks down user requests into technical components
2. **Task Planning**: Creates comprehensive, prioritized task lists with dependencies  
3. **Agent Selection**: Matches tasks to the most appropriate specialist agents
4. **Execution Coordination**: Manages handoffs and integration between agents
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors completion and maintains project coherence

### Example Orchestration Flow
```
User: "Build an e-commerce app with React frontend and Node.js backend"

Orchestrator:
├── nextjs-project-bootstrapper → Create React frontend structure
├── backend-api-architect → Design and implement API endpoints  
├── security-audit-specialist → Review authentication security
└── qa-test-engineer → Implement comprehensive test suite
```

## Agent Coordination

Agents work together seamlessly:
- **Sequential**: Backend API created before frontend integration
- **Parallel**: Security audit while QA engineer writes tests
- **Handoffs**: Orchestrator ensures each agent has necessary context from previous work
- **Integration**: All agents contribute to a cohesive final solution

## Getting Started

Agents are invoked automatically when tasks match their expertise. You can also explicitly request an agent:

```
"Use the security-audit-specialist to review my OAuth implementation"
"Have the project-orchestrator plan my new social media app"
```

Each agent delivers production-ready solutions with documentation, tests, and deployment guidance appropriate for their domain.
